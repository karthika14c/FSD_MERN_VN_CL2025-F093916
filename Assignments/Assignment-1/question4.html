                <h3>The Ultimate Productivity Hack is Saying No</h3>
                <p> The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.Not doing something will always be faster than doing it.
                    This
                    statement reminds me of the old computer programming saying, “Remember that there is no code faster
                    than no
                    code.”</p>
                <p>The same philosophy applies in other areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster
                    than
                    not having a meeting at all. <br>

                <p>This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say yes to many
                    things
                    we don't actually want to do. There are many meetings held that don't need to be held. There is a
                    lot of
                    code written that could be deleted.</p>

                <p>How often do people ask you to do something and you just reply, “Sure thing.” Three days later,
                    you're
                    overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by our obligations even though
                    we were
                    the ones who said yes to them in the first place.</p>
                <p>It's worth asking if things are necessary. Many of them are not, and a simple “no” will be more
                    productive
                    than whatever work the most efficient person can muster.

                    But if the benefits of saying no are so obvious, then why do we say yes so often?</p><a

                <h3>Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds</h3>
                <p> The economist J.K. Galbraith once wrote, “Faced with a choice between changing one’s mind and
                    proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy with the proof.”</p>
                <p>Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted
                    man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to
                    the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt,
                    what is laid before him.”</p>
                <p>What's going on here? Why don't facts change our minds? And why would someone continue to believe a
                    false or inaccurate idea anyway? How do such behaviors serve us?</p><a
